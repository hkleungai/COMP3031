This repository shows some of my course work on the course `COMP 3031 - Principles of Programming Languages`. 

Course description is as follows.
- Comparative studies of programming languages, programming language concepts and constructs. 
- Non-imperative programming paradigms: object-oriented, functional, logic, concurrent programming. 
- Basic concepts of program translation and interpretation. 
- Storage allocation and run-time organization.
